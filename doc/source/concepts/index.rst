Fundamental Concepts in Quantum JSON
------------------------------------

This chapter explains  a number of overarching concepts
in quantum json. This chapter is not a replacement for
further reference- and detail-chapters, however, this
chapter will give you an insight into the decisions
and the design process that went into some of the
things that are going on.

Having this insight will hopefully clear up a number 
of things, because some of these designs and decisions
are not intuitive. They mostly originated in experiences
and frustration at my work at Goodgame Studios, or while
developing applications with the standard org.json library.
